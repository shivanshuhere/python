## setup 

## keywords, identifiers and indentation
    
## first program 

## commnets and document interlude (naming, casing)

## User Input

## Variables
>### Rules for Python variables:

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
* A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

## Data Types
* Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex 
* Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
* Mapping Type:	dict
* Set Types:	set, frozenset
* Boolean Type:	bool
* Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
* None Type:	NoneType

## Core Objects and Functions
>Python's core objects are the fundamental building blocks of the language, encompassing data structures and entities that programs manipulate. These objects are categorized by type, each with specific properties and behaviors. Core functions are built-in operations that act upon these objects.

>### Core Object Types
* Numbers: Integers (e.g., 10, -5), floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5), and complex numbers.
* Booleans: Represent truth values, either True or False.
* Strings: Immutable sequences of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
* Lists: Mutable, ordered sequences of items (e.g., [1, 2, 'a']).
* Tuples: Immutable, ordered sequences of items (e.g., (1, 2, 'a')).
* Dictionaries: Mutable collections of key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}).
* Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
* None: Represents the absence of a value.

>### Core Functions
Type Conversion:
* Float(): Converts to a floating-point number.
* str(): Converts to a string.
* bool(): Converts to a boolean.
* list(): Converts to a list.
* tuple(): Converts to a tuple.
* dict(): Converts to a dictionary.
* set(): Converts to a set.
* Mathematical Functions:
* abs(): Returns the absolute value.
* pow(): Raises a number to a power.
* round(): Rounds a number.
* max(): Returns the maximum value.
* min(): Returns the minimum value.
* sum(): Returns the sum of elements.

>### Sequence Operations:
* len(): Returns the length of a sequence.
* sorted(): Returns a sorted list.
* reversed(): Returns a reversed iterator.

>### Input/Output:
* print(): Prints output to the console.
* input(): Reads input from the console.

>### Object Inspection:
* type(): Returns the type of an object.
* id(): Returns the unique identity of an object.
* dir(): Returns a list of valid attributes and methods of the object.

>### Iteration:
* iter(): Returns an iterator for an object.
* next(): Retrieves the next item from an iterator.

>### Boolean Operations:
* all(): Returns True if all elements are true.
* any(): Returns True if any element is true.
>### String Operations:
* str.lower(): Returns a lowercase version of the string.
* str.upper(): Returns an uppercase version of the string.
* str.split(): Splits the string into a list of substrings.
* str.join(): Concatenates a sequence of strings.
